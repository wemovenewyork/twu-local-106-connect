## TWU Local 106 Connect — Layer A Rebrand

This is a forked codebase. The fork point was 2026-05-06 from
`we-move-new-york-shift-swap@2e9d0ca`. From this point forward, this repo is
TWU Local 106 Connect, the official member portal for TWU Local 106
(Transit Supervisors Organization).

### Layer A: Surface branding (this batch)

- Centralized brand identity in `config/brand.ts` (single source of truth)
- Replaced all user-visible WMNY / We Move NY references
- New brand colors extracted from TSO logo (navy `#1A1F4D` + red `#AD1B27` + white)
- Replaced PWA icons with TSO logo (full size set + maskable + apple-touch)
- Updated email templates with Local 106 copy and colors
- Service worker cache renamed (`wmny-shell-v1` → `local106-shell-v1`)
- Invite code prefix changed (`WMNY-` → `L106-`; full removal in Layer C)
- Internal event names + sessionStorage keys renamed (`wmny:*` → `local106:*`)
- Static legal pages updated (terms, privacy, disclaimer)
- Print agreement page reflects Local 106 footer

### Layers still pending

- **Layer B**: Depot → Division entity rename (~580 lines, structural)
- **Layer C**: Schema additions (Division/SubUnit/News/Document), role refactor,
  registration flow change (admin approval), drop InviteCode model

## Earlier Highlights

### Swap Agreements
Both operators can formally agree to a swap inside the app. Once confirmed by both sides, you get a printable PDF confirmation to bring to your supervisor.

### Messaging
Direct messaging between operators, organized by swap. Quick-reply templates, message deletion, and notification badges for unread messages.

### Push Notifications
Get notified when someone is interested in your swap, when a message arrives, or when a swap agreement is confirmed — even when the app isn't open.

### Reputation System
Every operator builds a score based on completed swaps, cancellations, and peer reviews. Scores are shown on swap cards so you know who's reliable.

### Depot Announcements
Depot reps can pin announcements to the top of the swap board — useful for coverage shortages, schedule changes, or union updates.

### "I'll Take Anything" Mode
Toggle flexible mode to let other operators know you're open to any swap. You'll appear in a strip at the top of your depot's board.

### Rep Dashboard
Union stewards and depot reps get a dedicated dashboard with swap activity charts, agreement history, and operator reliability stats.

### Multi-Language
The app launched with English and Spanish. Chinese (中文) added in the latest release.

### Admin Tools
Admins can manage users, assign roles, send broadcast messages to all members or a specific depot, suspend accounts, and view a full audit log.
